## BTC-based applications

- Discrete log contracts (DLCs)
  - Contracts that use one or several oracle signatures for enforcement
  - Take less block space and more private when using adaptor signatures: the adaptor points on the oracle's expected signature. Each party gives each other invalid transaction signatures that can only be made valid in conjunction with the oracle signature
  
  - Based on ECDSA adaptor signatures on layer 1 (possibly on LN in the future):
    - Two parties send funds to a multi-signature address
    - In order to settle the transaction, an oracle signs the contract with a signature that corresponds to the hash of the winning outcome (e.g., specific strings)
    - The person with the hash that corresponds with the oracleâ€™s signature can then withdraw the funds from the contract
  - Actors: Suredbits, Crypto Garage, Atomic Loans, Square Crypto-funded Loyd Fornier, Chaincode Labs developer Antoine Riard
  - Major implementations on [bitcoin-s](https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s/tree/adaptor-dlc/dlc/src/main/scala/org/bitcoins/dlc), [NDLC](https://github.com/dgarage/NDLC), [rust-dlc](https://github.com/p2pderivatives/rust-dlc), [cfd-dlc](https://github.com/p2pderivatives/cfd-dlc)
  - Use cases:
    - betting (elections, sports) - 1st use case: [bet on 2020 US elections results](https://twitter.com/NicolasDorier/status/1303356212705030144) between Christian Stewart (Suredbits) and Nicolas Dorier (BTCPayServer) using [bitcoin-s], a JVM toolkit](https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s) and [this oracle](https://twitter.com/outcomeobserver)
    - hedging (e.g., forward contracts) or synthetic assets (synthetic gold in BTC-denominated terms)
   - DLC on the Lightning Network using Taproot
      - does not require parties to have a channel open with each other
      - requires barrier escrows which is not yet implemented
      - distribute trust between multiple oracles (no single point of failure)
