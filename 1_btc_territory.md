- Focal point (game theory)
  - a solution that people tend to choose by default in the absence of communication (e.g., meeting at noon in the middle of Grand Central Terminal in NYC)
  - also commonly called Scheeling point, as the theory was introduced by economist Thomas Schelling in his book The Strategy of Conflict, in 1960
  - other interesting points made in his book are: 1) often extreme and insane positions are taken for tactical reasons 2) even in the most bitter dispute, there is often room to stand together on common ground 3) We don't always have to like each other to get things done)
- Network effect (economics)
  - In economics, a network effect is the phenomenon by which the value (or utility) a user derives from a good or service depends on the number of users of compatible products.
  - Network effects are typically positive, resulting in a given user deriving more value from a product as other users join the same network.
- Lindsey effect
  - The Lindy effect is a theory that the future life expectancy of technology or ideas is proportional to their current age.
  - The longer a technology or an idea is around, the higher change it will stay around for longer: its mortality rate decreases with time.
