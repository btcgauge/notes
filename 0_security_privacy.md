### Create a protonmail account in a private way:
  - https://www.protonmail.com
  - do not provide a backup email account
  - use a strong password (https://xkcd.com/936/) but make sure to keep it in a password manager (https://privacytools.io/software/passwords/)
  - use a disposable temporary e-mail address (https://www.guerrillamail.com) to prove that your a human being and not a bot
  - protonmail rejects some top-level domains for security reason, so try a few until protonmail accepts the email address (https://www.guerrillamail.com offers several top-level domains, e.g., pokemail.net)
