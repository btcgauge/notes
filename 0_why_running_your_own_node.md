Rebuttal to Common Criticisms: Bitcoin is ...
Criticism | Rebuttal
--- | ---
Too volatile | The Bitcoin technology is very stable with an uptime 99.985% (it was down for 15 hours - in 2010 and 2013 - over the 10+ years of Bitcoin's existence). The USD/BTC price being very volatile is a feature of its adoption being very early. The USD/BTC price can be seen as Bitcoin's expected value = USD/BTC in the long term x chances of happening. A price of $10,000 means that the market on average thinks that there is 1% chance for USD/BTC to reach $1M. The year-on-year price increase has been steady (*ADD REFERENCE*). The volatility is likely to decrease as the Bitcoin adoption life cycle moves to later phases
Just for speculation | Speculation on assets with high volatility is not uncommon, but the steady increase in the year-on-year USD/BTC price is sign that 
A bubble that will pop | Bitcoin has stood the test of time in spite the numerous predictions of its downfall (https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries). Even Satoshi Nakamoto was uncertain Bitcoin would succeed (*ADD REFERENCE*)
Can be replicated | Bitcoin Cash vs Bitcoin
Used by criminals | USD, EUR
Not money or currency | Early days: cash payment, now: store of value + settlement system for second layer solutions (Lightning Network, Liquid)

Meme | Why | How
--- | --- | ----

Don't trust, verify | Verify that your transactions was added to a block to prove ownership | Run your own node
Bitcoin, not blockchain | A response to the 'Blockchain, not Bitcoin' / 'Blockchain technology' / 'Distributed Ledger Technology' memes from 2016 | Blockchain is one required component in Bitcoin, but, on its own, is not necessarily permissionless, secure or censorship resistant
Bitcoin does not care | Many in the Bitcoin community have strong opinions about economics and social topics, but Bitcoin remains a censorship resistant, permissionless, secure means of payment no matter what your or other's opinions are | Learn about the Bitcoin technology and make your own opinion.
