1. Create a protonmail account in private way:
  * https://www.protonmail.com
  * do not provide a backup email account
  * use a strong password (https://xkcd.com/936/) but make sure to keep it in a password manager (https://privacytools.io/software/passwords/)
  * use a disposable temporary e-mail address (https://www.guerrillamail.com) to prove that your a human being and not a bot
  * protonmail rejects some top-level domains for security reason, so try a few until protonmail accepts the email address (https://www.guerrillamail.com offers several top-level domains, e.g., pokemail.net)

3. Git and Github tutorial for poets - 8 - Github pages
 * default branch is “master”
 * switch/create to “gh-pages” branch

 * delete the master branch: Code tab > Branches > all branches > Trash icon
 * Github > Settings tab > Github pages
 * It can be configured to link to your custom URL
     * set domain in Github > Settings > Github pages > Custom domain. It will create a file named CNAME. Don’t delete it
     * on your domain name register, under DNS, set at least 2 records:
         * Name: @, Type: A, IPv4 addresses: 185.199.108.153, 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153 and 185.199.111.153
         * Name: www (or/and other subdomains), Type: CNAME, IPv4 address: YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io
     * https://app.streamline.to/home for free icons
     * https://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/coderpro/bs4/contact.html for theme ideas
 * Github > Create New File: .html (or .txt file). Best: index.html

3. Install Ubuntu Server LTS on VirtualBox, and access it with SSH

  3.1. Overview - main tasks
    3.1.1. Pre-requisites: ~ 400 GB free HD space (unless pruning is used after the initial blockchain download - that take days to complete)
    3.1.2. Setting up VirtualBox, a free, open source virtual machine host 
    3.1.3. Installing and configuring the latest stable, long-term version of Ubuntu Server within virtual machine host
    3.1.4. Installing and configuring a Bitcoin Core full node
    3.1.5. Configuring bitcoind to run over Tor network (privacy + avoid need to modify home router settings to allow incoming Bitcoin network traffic)

  3.2. VirtualBox
    3.2.1 Download the latest stable version (6.1+) of VirtualBox (http://www.virtualbox.org)
    3.2.2 Download the Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack (same version as the Virtual Box -> support for USB 2/3. disk encryption, etc)

  3.3. Download latest Ubuntu Server LTS (Option 3) ISO (disc image) LTS (Long-term Support) = supported for 5 years

  3.4. Install Ubuntu Linux server virtual machine
    3.4.1. Start VirtualBox

    3.4.6. Storage on physical hard disk: Dynamically allocated (default)
    3.4.7. File location and size: default location; size = at least 400 KB (610 GB -> VirtualBox won’t consume this space immediately, but will grow the virtual disk in size as needed, up to that limit). On Jan 1, 2016, the BTC blockchain size was about 55MB and since then, it increases by 50MB every year
    3.4.8. (optional) in order to increase the size of the virtual disk: File > Virtual Media Manager
    3.4.9. Start Icon > Normal Start
    3.4.10. Click on the folder icon then Add and go to the Ubuntu .ISO file location; Choose; Start and let it run
    13.4.1. You cannot use your mouse to navigate the graphical interface. To navigate the text-based installer, you cannot use your mouse. You will need to use the arrow keys to move among selections, the TAB key to jump to confirmation buttons, and the ENTER key to select

    3.4.21. Profile setup: name, server name, username and password
    3.4.22. Install OpenSSH server
    3.4.23. Import SSH identity: NO or from Github or from Launchpad

    3.4.25. Once the installation is complete, choose Reboot
    3.4.26. Press Enter when prompted to Please remove the installation media (VirtualBox will try unmount a cdrom instead of the .iso)
    3.4.27. The VM will reboot, and after a few minutes you’ll see the login prompt; login and then get the latest security and software updates
    3.4.8. run $: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade (Do you want to continue? y ENTER)

This way, you will be able to start the Bitcoin Core server installation from a fresh Ubuntu install (instead of starting from scratch) if something goes wrong in the next steps (cloning takes less than 5 minutes)
